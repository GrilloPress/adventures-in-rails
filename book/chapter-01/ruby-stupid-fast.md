## Stupid Fast Ruby

In this short section we'll quickly cover some basic Ruby to reintroduce it. This will be a whirlwind chapter of examples.

#### Files

Ruby files end with ```.rb```. To create embedded ruby files with HTML you create an extension like so: ```index.html.erb```. The ```.erb``` comes at the end.

#### Variables

You can declare variables like so:

```
text = "text"
numb = 5
```
