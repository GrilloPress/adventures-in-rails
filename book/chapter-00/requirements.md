# Requirements

To get the most out of this book you will need to have a little bit of experience building websites or using a programming language.

I don't mean lots. Just a little. If you've built a website, or HTML email, or use the command-line or something like Java, PHP or Ruby before you should have enough skills to follow along.

That said, if you are brave, you can totally follow along with some googling to help get past anything you find difficult or confusing.

## Technical Requirements

In this book I will not focus too much on the environment you are using to install Rails as, and this can be the tough love part, Rails and Windows just don't mix.

If you are on a windows machine, don't despair. 

You can still use Windows if you are super brave however [via the Ruby/Rails installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/), you can also use one of the many fine services like [Codio](www.codio.com) and use your browser to connect to a Linux machine, for free, and get a Rails friendly Ubuntu box.

That is what I recommend. In fact, I am writing this book through Codio using a Chromebook!

> Codio is not the only browser-based IDE you can leverage. Some alternatives are:
> + [Codio](www.codio.com)
> + Cloud9
> + CodeAnywhere
> + ...
> I personally prefer Codio as I find it has all the important features without being bloated and confusing, whilst also being the fastest and most reliable.

Other than this, you need to get Ruby installed on your machine. I'll go through getting Rails set up but you should be able to get Ruby on your machine.

To do so, [following the instructions here to install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

## Personal Requirements

Beyond experience with some form of building things with code or having run through some tutorials before, you need to have the following skills:

+ Ability to Google and adapt your search terms until you find what you need
+ Perseverance and patience

And that is pretty much it.
