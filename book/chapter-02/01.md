## Install Sqlite

In this book we are going to use Sqlite.

Sqlite is a SQL database that creates a local ```.sqlite``` file on your fileserver which stores your database.

Sqlite is basically what powers Android applications. It is not as robust or scalable as MySQL or Postgresql but if your app is small, it will be more than good enough. [For more information about when to use Sqlite, see the Sqlite website](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html)

To install Sqlite, [you need to download the file for your distribution from the website](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and install it.

If you have a problem getting sqlite to run, google ```install sqlite {{your operating system}}``` which should return decent documentation.
