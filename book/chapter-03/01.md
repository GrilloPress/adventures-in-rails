# Creating your Static Marketing Page

In this section we will cover creating a static marketing page for our app. This will include the form we'll use for our app, though we won't wire it up to save messages to the database just yet.

By the end of this chapter we'll have covered:

- Creating static pages in Rails
- Setting up routes
- creating controllers
- creating views
- Installing Bootstrap
- Writing a little bit of Sass, the CSS preprocessor
- Mocking up our application's form

## Creating a basic Controller

1. The MVC idea

You may have heard a lot about the MVC pattern as you've started to look into Rails and other web frameworks. It is both an important concept and something that will soon be so natural you'll pay no heed to it,

The Model View Controller idea is just a theory where you separate your application's code into distinct files or types of files. It is what guides the Rails file structure.

> We'll not cover the theory of MVC in-depth in this book. We'll focus on using the pattern... 

In regard to Rails, your Model is essentially the code that manages how things are saved to your database. The code that refers to how you shape or transform things before they are saved into your database.

The controller is the glue code between your model and the views and routes. That is, your controller in Rails, tells your app which HTML to render when a certain route or web address is visited and what steps to go through when a certain action is triggered. So, when someone wants to save a new blog post, it is your controller which lays out the process to save any form input (with your model code the place where any input is checked before it is saved into the database and how the data is manipulated or transformed before it is saved).

Your views are basically the things a client or user sees. The bare HTML and CSS. The outward appearance of things.

The MVC pattern is just a guideline. It is not a do or die thing and as a developer you'll end up creating things that could live in either the M or C and it will be up to you to decide which place it lives (and no decision will actually be correct, but based on what you or the team you are in prefers!).

The MVC pattern may be something you have encountered before.

The MVC pattern tries to separate three major parts of every application.

The Model, or database, the View, or outward appearance of your app, and the controller, the code which connects how your view looks and how things are saved to your model
