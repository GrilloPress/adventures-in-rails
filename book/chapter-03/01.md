# Creating your Static Marketing Page

In this section we will cover creating a static marketing page for our app. This will include the form we'll use for our app, though we won't wire it up to save messages to the database just yet.

By the end of this chapter we'll have covered:

- Creating static pages in Rails
- Setting up routes
- creating controllers
- creating views
- Installing Bootstrap
- Writing a little bit of Sass, the CSS preprocessor
- Mocking up our application's form

## Creating a basic Controller

The MVC idea

The MVC pattern may be something you have encountered before.

The MVC pattern tries to separate three major parts of every application.

The Model, or database, the View, or outward appearance of your app, and the controller, the code which connects how your view looks and how things are saved to your model
