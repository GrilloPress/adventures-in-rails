# Creating your Static Marketing Page

In this section we will cover creating a static marketing page for our app. This will include the form we'll use for our app, though we won't wire it up to save messages to the database just yet.

By the end of this chapter we'll have covered:

- Creating static pages in Rails
- Setting up routes
- creating controllers
- creating views
- Installing Bootstrap
- Writing a little bit of Sass, the CSS preprocessor
- Mocking up our application's form

## Creating a basic Controller

1. The MVC idea

You may have heard a lot about the MVC pattern as you've started to look into Rails and other web frameworks. It is both an important concept and something that will soon be so natural you'll eventually work within it without thinking about it too much.

The Model View Controller idea is just a theory where you separate your application's code into distinct files or types of files. It is what guides the Rails file structure.

> We'll not cover the theory of MVC in-depth in this book. We'll focus primarily on using the pattern. 

In regard to Rails, your Model is essentially the code that manages how things are saved to your database. The code that refers to how you shape or transform things before they are saved into your database.

The controller is the glue code between your model and the views and routes. That is, your controller in Rails, tells your app which HTML to render when a certain route or web address is visited and what steps to go through when a certain action is triggered. So, when someone wants to save a new blog post, it is your controller which lays out the process to save any form input (with your model code the place where any input is checked before it is saved into the database and how the data is manipulated or transformed before it is saved).

Your views are basically the things a client or user sees. The bare HTML and CSS. The outward appearance of things.

The MVC pattern is just a guideline. It is not a do or die thing and as a developer you'll end up creating things that could live in either the M or C and it will be up to you to decide which place it lives (and no decision will actually be correct, but based on what you or the team you are in prefers!).

In short then:

+ _M_ is the Model, which is your code that defines the data concept. In practical terms, that is what fields are saved to your database, how they are validated etc.
+ _V_ is the View, the code that controls the externally viewable product. In practical terms, this is your HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
+ _C_ is the Controller, the code that binds the view and model together and connects the two. In practical terms, your controller code tells Rails which view to render and what processes to go through and what data to provide to your view.

As you can see, the MVC pattern is a way to organize your code into seperate chunks with distinct but interconnecting jobs. Let's start jumping into Rails by creating our first controller.

To generate a controller you can run the following command:

```
rails g controller {name of controller} {additional options}
```

The `g` in this command stands for generate (you can also run this command using the full word generate, though the shorthand avoids typos).

We'll create a marketing page controller. The Rails Controller naming convention is to use plural names for controllers (and singular names for models) so let's call our controller MarketingPages. This will mean our controller will be called the snappy title of `MarketingPagesController`.

To generate our controller, run the following command:

```sh
rails g controller MarketingPages index
```

Here we have generated our MarketingPages controller and offered the additional option or command of index. This just makes a method (or "function") called index within our controller for us.
